20.2 (p 474): Categorial Status of Modals

- modality in formal approaches is tied to the expression of possibility and necessity
- (in English) modals have auxiliary-like properties: not inflected, take negation directly, invert in interrogatives, can be stranded in ellipsis, can have polarity emphasis
- syntactic status distinct from main verbs
- transformational/minimalism/etc: modals are generated in aux position distinct from that of main verbs (usually called I or Infl (inflection)

The crucial facts (in English)
    - modals invariable precede, and dominate, any other verbs or aux
    - modals are not tensed
    - modals lack finite and non-finite inflection.
    - modals invariably precede negation.
    - modals do not trigger do-support.

Except for the last two properties, these are all distinct from other auxiliaries like "have" and "be". 

In G/B theory: have/be are generated in the head of a V-type projection, and they move when the I domain is available. 

Note: "do" is generated similarly to modals, but as a last resort supportsinflection.

More complex in German (and Yiddish):
    - modals DO have finite and infinitival forms (zoln; ikh zol)
    - can be inflected for tense and mood (ikh hot gekent sprakhn yidish)
    - no positional difference between modals and main verbs

Evidence for I node in German has been questioned in a number of papers
